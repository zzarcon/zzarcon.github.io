The first time I see a javascript code was almost 5 ago, when I was a student, and that don't be much interesting for me, was in a exercise when we have to handle a click on a button and latter perfom a validation for check if the string was a valid email; In that times I wrote a lot of Java code, and I was feeling very important doing a lot of inheritance, creating interfaces, and defining privated things...

But all this have been changed when I finish my studies and I was discovering the first webs apps; at the begining I can't understand how developers making this sites, all I know about web technologies was static marckup, some ugly styles and saving data though forms, so when I was using this apps and feeling their smothness and usability I was crazy (the big win for me was discover AJAX and don't perform a full page reload for each interaction with the server), so I was motivated myself for learn as much I can about that language. Many things beats me in the first days, things like prototypal inheritance, the use of functions for everything, the non typed variables and anothers wtf (http://wtfjs.com/).

Later I was submergido in the jQuery spaghetty world, performing `$.ajax` againts my own PHP apis (if I can call that Api), storing a lot of data in the DOM, for me the DOM was like a non relation DB `troll`, inserting and removing a lot of dynamic string templates and css classes for achieve a "reactive UI" (in the end I was haven't any app model either app status). They was a funny time, I was shipping very fast and unmatenible stuff,

Node.js for me was like a panacea, one language for controle the rest, but I was ending doing similar bad practices like in my client side code like making direct sql consultes without ORM, storing ALL THE THINGS in mysql, and ending with files of hundreds of lines... In that time I know about the existence of other languages like Phyton or Ruby, I listened from developers that this frameworks where awesome and as a developer I'll love that, but in my interior I was still think something like "Cammon guys Node.js rocks!! you only have to learn one language and you can write a entire app, also you can reuse the same library in both sides, client and server, WOW!"

My conclusion is that after reading and writing soo much javascript I don't know if I'm a great js developer; along this years I still getting sorprendido and confused about the language, their direction in the future and their diary mind fucks that fact me hace pensar cada vez mas in that I don't want to be a great js developer with a long experience with X or Y framework, I don't want to write js all my lifex
