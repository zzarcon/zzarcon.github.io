Hi there, I'm Hector a 23 years old frontend engineer from Valencia, Spain, now living in Barcelona, I like to skate, take super awesome photos (selfies), ink my body, travel the world, spend my money in useless things and some other stuff not very interesting for you, so in this blog I'll talk about my thoughts and own experiences in software development... :\

There are many things that turn me on but for now I'm super obsessed with things like Ember.js, meetings, native apps, jsonapi, software conventions, architecture and new paradigms. Right now I spend most if my time writing Javascript and their friends HTML and CSS, for that reason I'm working as a web frontend engineer in a videogame company :), but don't worry, I don't want to do the same all my life, I'm constantly working in my own side projects (alone or with my favorite and amazing friends), realising small and useless libraries, or reading cool stuff from guys more smart than me. I hope you like my small blog, cheers!
